### **Project 1**

#### **Food Sales Prediction**

This repository has the objective of processing data and implementing Machine Learning methods to predict the sale of food products that are sold in different stores.

#### **Goals**

* Predict the sales of the establishments of the chain 'Coding Dojo XYZ'.
* Identify the main factors that explain the behavior and prediction of sales.

#### **Considerations**

* Database that contains information regarding the sale of products in establishments of the 'Coding Dojo XYZ' chain.
  * 8,523 registers and 12 variables

* A data cleaning and mining process was carried out to address missing values, inconsistencies in the base, determine classifications, among others.

* The relationship between the variables was determined by descriptive statistics.

* Machine Learning models were estimated with the aim of being able to better predict sales, based on a set of explanatory variables and determining the estimate on a training and validation/test sample.
  * Test base size = 30%

#### **Data Visualization**

**Distribution of sales by type of product**
